```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Load our two tables: 
```{r}
wnba_salaries <- read_csv("data/wnba_salaries.csv")
wnba_teams <- read_csv("data/wnba_teams.csv")
```

Practice joins
```{r}
anti_join(wnba_salaries, wnba_teams, by = c("name" = "player_name"))

# Isabelle Harrison & Lou Lopez Senechal not on team rosters (but have salaries?)

anti_join(wnba_teams, wnba_salaries, by = c("player_name" = "name"))

# AD Durr is on a team (Dream) but doesn't have a salary
```
Combine the tables: 
```{r}
full_join(wnba_teams, wnba_salaries, by = c("player_name" = "name"))

wnba_teams %>% full_join(wnba_salaries, by = c("player_name"="name"))
```
